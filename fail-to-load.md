I am very sorry for that you cannot see the 2 pages. It's because of the browser sercurity policy.

Here is the simplest solution to it:

First you click the address input of your browser, and you may find the URL starts with _https_,

<img class="image" src="/assets/images/fail-to-load-1.png" />

you just remove the _s_, and press _Enter_ Key.

<img class="image" src="/assets/images/fail-to-load-2.png" />

Now, you can see the 2 pages loaded,

<img class="image" src="/assets/images/fail-to-load-3.png" />

This website does not ask you to transfer sensitive information, thus, you don't need to worry.
