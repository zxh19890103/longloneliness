# The Long Loneliness

## Welcome

Are you feeling lonely? Or, you get better now, but, you can remember that period of time you were feeling lonely. What's your story? Will you tell it to me?

Welcome!

I created this site to **share** the feeling of loneliness from human beings. But, furthermore, I also hope one day a warm community would be formed to comfort the lonely hearts all around the world.

What motivates me to do this is *I AM LONELY*.

## Who I am in brief

I am from the mainland of China, a man, 35 years old, still be single, a programmer with 10 years' experience. I got sick, a sick I'm shameful to tell my friends and family, 4 years ago. I know I could be loved and welcomed by many of my colleagues and girls. However, the disease makes me afraid to play with them. So, I keep distance away from them and live in a solitude way. Few people can talk to me, and no girl can come to me to say hello.

## The story of you

If you will, you can write down your story of being lonely. Don't worry about your privacy, you don't need to say anything of your private information. I don't know who you are, and you don't know me either. 

But, let's be honest first.

Check my email address bellow, and tell me your story by composing an email to me. I will publish it on the page, then every lonely one will read it and connect to you. That's help to ease your pain.
